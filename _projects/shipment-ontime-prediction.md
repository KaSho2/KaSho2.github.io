# Can We Predict if a Shipment Will Be On Time?

**Summary**  
Built classification models to predict on-time shipment outcomes using structured features, then compared approaches and tuned models.

**What I did**
- Prepared and cleaned dataset; engineered meaningful input features.
- Trained baseline and tree-based classifiers.
- Tuned models using **GridSearchCV** and evaluated results using classification metrics.
- Presented findings in a recruiter-friendly narrative (problem → approach → results).

**Skills:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, logistic regression, decision trees, GridSearchCV, feature engineering, model evaluation.
