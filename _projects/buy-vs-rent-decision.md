**Summary**  
Created a decision model to evaluate buying vs renting by combining data assumptions with a structured utility-based framework and sensitivity analysis.

**What I did**
- Built a decision framework that outputs a recommendation under different scenarios.
- Used a **utility function** and visual sensitivity analysis (including tornado-style comparisons).
- Gathered external inputs (housing market + demographic indicators) to ground assumptions.

**Skills:** decision modeling, utility functions, sensitivity analysis, scenario planning, structured recommendations.
