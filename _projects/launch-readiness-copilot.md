# Process Capability & Launch Readiness Copilot (EPD 522 Academic Capstone)

> Note: This is an **academic course capstone (EPD 522)**, not my Master’s capstone.

**Summary**  
Designed a pilot concept for a decision-support workflow that helps engineers evaluate whether a process is **stable and capable enough** to support a product launch or volume ramp, while keeping final responsibility with human reviewers.

**What I did**
- Defined the problem and scope for a safe pilot (limited datasets, no production integration).
- Designed an “engineer-first” flow: stability check → capability calculation (deterministic tools) → clear written summary.
- Built risk controls to prevent over-trust and ensure human oversight.

**Skills:** SPC framing, capability reporting concepts, workflow design, scope control, risk mitigation, leadership-ready communication.
