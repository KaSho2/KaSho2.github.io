**Summary**  
Developed multiple machine learning approaches to classify breast cancer outcomes and compared performance across models and preprocessing strategies.

**What I did**
- Built supervised models including **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, and **Random Forest**.
- Applied preprocessing (e.g., **StandardScaler**) and hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**.
- Explored clustering using **K-Means** to understand structure in the data.
- Evaluated models and communicated results clearly.

**Skills:** Python, scikit-learn, logistic regression, KNN, random forest, scaling, GridSearchCV, k-means, evaluation.
