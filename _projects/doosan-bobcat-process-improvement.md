**Summary**  
Improved efficiency and ergonomics for a tire installation workstation by reducing non-value-added waste and recommending practical layout + process changes.

**What I did**
- Mapped current state using **SIPOC** and **spaghetti diagrams**.
- Identified waste and ergonomic risks; proposed solutions for organization + lifts/fixtures.
- Used **MOST analysis** to estimate cycle-time improvements.
- Built a cost-benefit case and sustainability plan (audits, training, standard work).

**Skills:** Lean (5S), PDCA, SIPOC, spaghetti diagram, ergonomics, MOST, cost-benefit analysis, continuous improvement.
