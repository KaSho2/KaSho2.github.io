**Summary**  
Designed and optimized a spur gear for metal additive manufacturing by combining **Topology Optimization** and **Generative Design**, then compared performance and estimated manufacturing cost/time.

**What I did**
- Built baseline gear CAD and parameterized key geometry.
- Ran structural analysis to evaluate stress and performance.
- Generated optimized designs using topology optimization + generative design workflows.
- Compared weight, strength, manufacturability, and estimated AM cost/time.

**Skills:** SolidWorks, ANSYS Workbench, Fusion 360 (Generative Design + Topology Optimization), FEA, DfAM, cost estimation, technical documentation.
